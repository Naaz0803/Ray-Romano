        <h1>JAMIE FLOYD:  UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</h1><br>
        <p>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But <br>
             we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"</p>
             <br>
             <h2>DONNA AND SCOTT:  RESCUED RENOVATION</h2><br>
             <p id="p2">"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know  <br>
                it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"</p>
           <br>
                <h3>DAVID SIEGEL:  DOUBLED THE VALUE</h3><br>
                <p id="p3">"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut <br>
                     renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home improvements."</p>
